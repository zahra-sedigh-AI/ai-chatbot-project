It is designed as a lightweight and extensible prototype for AI-driven applications.

## Features

- AI-powered conversational chatbot
- Persian language support
- Streaming responses
- Custom system prompt

## Technologies

- Python
- LLM API (GPT-based)
- Prompt engineering

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Set your API key as an environment variable or create a .env file based on .env.example:
export API_KEY=your_api_key_here

## Run the chatbot:
python chatbot.py

## Type your messages in the terminal and receive real-time AI responses. This project can be used as an educational AI assistant, a prototype for conversational AI systems, or a foundation for more advanced AI and data-driven applications.
